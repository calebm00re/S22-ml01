    "### In your own words, give an overview of the dataset. Describe the purpose of the data set you selected (i.e., why and how was this data collected in the first place?).\n",
    "This dataset has several features of automobiles that can add or subtract from a cars value depending on what is considered desirable. Maybe you want more cylinders and are willing to pay for the bigger engine, maybe leather interior commands a higher premium, maybe the years since it came out have a measuable function of depreciation that can be applied to all vehicles. These statistics are simple to observe from a vehicle's window sticker or assess when a vehicle is traded in. This information can also be looked up with the automobiles vin number. The purpose of this data is commonly to determine an appropriate price for the vehicle.\n",
    "### What is the prediction task for your data and why are other third parties interested in the result?\n",
    "We plan to predict the vehicle's price with this data. Third parties are often interested in this information to compare what they paid or what they are planning to pay for a new or used car. They want to know if they are underpaying or if they are getting a reasonable deal. Dealerships, both new and used, also want to determine a price at which a customer would be willing to strike a deal with them. This ensures both parties are happy in the transaction.\n",
    "### Once you begin modeling, how well would your prediction algorithm need to perform to be considered useful to these third parties?\n",
    "We plan to shoot for 85% accuracy. We have the luxury of this being a monetary transaction, so while you don't want to be overpaying for a vehicle or have it priced incorrectly and either lose a bunch of money or, worse, lose some money. We feel if we price the cars accurately 85% of the time, we'd be confident in using our model to estimate the price of a vehicle. We also plan to count a vehicle as priced accurately if it is within a range based on the percentage of the cars price or estimated price. This ensures we can achieve a level of accuracy that doesn't require us be spot on the dollar amount of the vehicle, as that isn't very realistic."
